"""Runtime configuration loader for the sandbox service.

This module defines :class:`RunConfig`, a pydantic model that is populated
from a YAML configuration file at startup.  The YAML file is chosen by the
``SANDBOX_CONFIG`` environment variable (default ``"local"``), and the
corresponding ``<name>.yaml`` is resolved relative to this module's directory.

``RunConfig`` follows the **singleton pattern**: call
:meth:`RunConfig.get_instance_sync` to obtain the shared instance.  Direct
construction via ``RunConfig()`` is supported but discouraged outside tests.

            ``"lite"`` -- handcrafted overlayfs + chroot + cgroups isolation,
            fast (< 100 ms overhead).
            ``"full"`` -- Docker container isolation with resource limits.
            ``"bindroot"`` -- recursive bind-mount of ``/`` + per-exec
            tmpfs scratch + chroot.  Apptainer-compatible alternative to
            ``"lite"`` for hosts where overlay-on-rootfs is unavailable.
        max_concurrency : int
            Maximum number of sandbox instances that may run in parallel.
            Set to ``0`` to disable the internal concurrency limiter (useful
            when concurrency is managed externally, e.g. by pytest-xdist).
        docker_image : str
            Docker image used when ``isolation`` is ``"full"``.
            Defaults to ``"ineil77/sandbox-fusion-server:25042026-2"``.
        default_memory_limit_mb : int
            Default memory limit in megabytes for each sandbox execution.
            Overridden by per-request ``memory_limit_MB`` when > 0.
        default_cpu_limit : float
            Default CPU core limit for each sandbox execution.
            In lite mode this sets the CFS quota; in full mode it maps
            to ``docker run --cpus``.
        docker_startup_overhead : float
            Extra seconds added to compile and run timeouts in full
            (Docker) isolation mode to account for container startup
            latency.  Has no effect in lite mode.
